# QuizGameMobileApp
This is my fourth college project - A mobile app quiz game that ask users various questions and rewards them with points that can be converted to actual money.
This project is kinda discotinued in a way because it did not garner too much attention to my professors, and plus, the point conversion is not implemented because we cannot find any source of money to make the feature work.
